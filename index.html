      <h2>Why I chose ICT</h2>
      <p>Ever since I was small I've had a list of careers that I thought sounded cool, and on that list was
        game designer. Plus the job market and salary for programmers aren't bad either.
      </p>
      <h2>Why I'll be good at it</h2>
      <p>I like to think that ICT is a suitable field for me. In school my maths marks were average, but I've
        always excelled at languages. I know that ICT is a very maths-based study, but in my opinion it also
        has a lot to do with language. So I hope my natural affinity for languages helps me for the next four
        years.</p>
