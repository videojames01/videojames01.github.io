<p>I went to the open day in March 2023, and that really helped cement my choice to study at the HZ. After my
    study, I'm not quite sure yet. I'll see which classes I enjoy most to help me decide which track to pick.
    I've been building a list of careers that sound interesting ever since I could think, and game developer
    always sounded cool.</p>
