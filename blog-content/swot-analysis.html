    I have a few strengths that I believe will help me in my studies. I am hardworking, organised, and good at
    problem solving. I think organisation will help me keep my code-quality neat, which will be beneficial to
    myself, as well as to others once I begin with group projects. I also enjoy problem solving because it feels
    like a puzzle that I have to solve; sometimes it can be frustrating, but once I've discovered the solution it
    makes all the frustration worth it.
  </p>

    My weaknesses are my low self-confidence, indecisiveness, and tendency to become overwhelmed. I've struggled
    with decision-making for most of my life, whether it's something small, like choosing what to drink at a restaurant,
    or a big decision, like choosing what to study. I am working on this, but for now my solution is just choosing
    something instead of waiting endlessly. I'm also working on my low self-confidence, and I've noticed progress!
    However, I don't want to become TOO self-confident, so that is something I need to watch out for.
  </p>

    During this study, I see the opportunity to expand my knowledge, build my character, and build lasting relationships.
    A few potential threats could be my job and my lack of coding experience. My working hours won't conflict with
    my study hours, but the workload might become too much for me.
