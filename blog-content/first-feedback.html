  <h2>My First Feedback</h2>
  <p>
    In my first feedback, I received concern that my motivation wasn't enough to get me through the ICT study. I
    must admit that at the time of filling in the "Who Am I?" questionnaire I was still not sure whether or not I
    would choose the HZ. I think that across text I might have sounded more unmotivated than I was meaning to be.
    Which specific study I chose wasn't really important to me, obviously I wasn't choosing at random, but I had
    a list of different studies that I wanted to do. That doesn't mean that I am not taking my studies seriously,
    I fully intend to put 100% effort into everything I do here.
  </p>

    There was also concern about my working hours conflicting with my studies. For the last two weeks I have been
    working three evenings a week, and I found that it didn't effect my studies at all! I got enough sleep,
    managed to make considerable progress with my website, and still had personal time to spend by myself or with
    my friends. I know it might not stay this way later on in the study, once I become more busy, but I can always
    work less hours as I have a 0-hour contract.
