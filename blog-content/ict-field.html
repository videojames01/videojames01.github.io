    <h2>The ICT Field</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>
      While building this website, I researched some different careers in the ICT field. A few that I thought sounded
      really cool were: web developer, software tester, game developer, and ethical hacker. Obviously I need more
      experience to figure out what I really enjoy, but at face value these seem really interesting. What I think
      I'd enjoy about being a web or game developer is taking ideas and being able to turn them into a reality, and
      being able to see my progress as I work on my projects.

      I also think I'd enjoy being a software tester or ethical hacker. I've always thought about being a proofreader,
      as I love searching for and finding errors, and my attention to detail helps me with this. Doing this with software
      would add a few extra layers to the challenge! I'll be hunting for and eliminating errors, like some kind of
      error hitman.
