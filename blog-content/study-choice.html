<p>I went to the open day in March 2023, and that really helped cement my choice to study at the HZ. After my
    study, I don't know. Game design sounds like a cool idea but realistically I have no idea what it entails.
    I can't decide what I'm going to do if I have no idea what my options are and which of them I find most
    enjoyable.</p>
