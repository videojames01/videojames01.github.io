    <h2>Where I'm from</h2>
      <p>I'm from South Africa but I came to the Netherlands in May last year. I travelled all over to see the Dutch side
        of my family; my mom was born here so I have a ton of uncles and aunts and cousins. Now I live in a studio apartment in the
        APV campus in Middelburg, a 3 minute walk away from the HZ, so I don't have to get up too early.
      </p>
    <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>I work as a waiter at Cafe Tympaan in the city centre, we're always looking for more colleagues so if you need a job
        I can put in a word for you! I jump around between different hobbies a lot; now that I have a laptop I've been gaming again,
        I'm more into offline story based games than online multiplayer. I also enjoy reading, although I don't do it very often, and
        I like cross stitching, fishing, building puzzles, playing board games. Basically I'm an old man.
