        <summary>How can you print a document from your laptop at HZ?</summary>
        Go to <a href="https://hz.mynetpay.nl" target="_blank">hz.mynetpay.nl</a> and select "Web Print". Choose
        your preferred format and the number of copies you would like. Select a maximum of 10 files, either by
        dragging or browsing, and upload them. I think that's how it works.

        <summary>What are the instructions if you want to park your car at the HZ parking lot?</summary>
        It is not possible to park at the Groene Woud campus. The parking lot on Kousteensedijk has a number of
        spaces for visitors, staff and students of Het Groene Woud. This car park is an 8-minute walk from the
        HZ. When you show your entry card at the JRCZ service desk, located next to the HZ building, you can get
        an exit card.
