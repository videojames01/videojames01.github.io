      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        My motivation for this study (and for most things in my life) is that I love the sense of achievement I
        get after doing something well. I know it sounds a bit weird, but I love working. I love completing tasks
        and seeing the results of my efforts, and I love trying my best at those tasks so that I can be proud of
        myself. I don't love failing, but I do love the feeling I get after figuring something out that I didn't
        understand before. I know that this motivation isn't very specific to ICT, and I have to be honest, ICT
        was only one option from quite a few studies I found interesting. But I think that it does help me get out
        of bed everyday, excited to learn and grow and be the best version of myself that I can be.
      </p>
      <h2>Why it's right for me</h2>
      <p>
        I like to think that ICT is a suitable field for me. In school I've always excelled at languages. I
        know that ICT is a very maths-based study, but in my opinion it also has a lot to do with language. I do
        have a small amount of experience with Python programming, but overall I'm basically a complete beginner. Considering this,
        I'm quite proud of how far I've come in the last two weeks. It's reassured me a bit that I have the capacity
        to understand everything I'll be learning in the next 4 years.
