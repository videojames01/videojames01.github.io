    <h2>My Programming Experience</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>
      I have very little previous programming experience. After finishing high school I started a python programming
      course on Udemy. I found it to be quite enjoyable and interesting, and it's part of why I was
      interested in studying ICT! Unfortunately, my laptop was stolen before I could complete the course, but I did complete
      my first milestone project, which was a game of noughts and crosses, very simple, but I was proud of myself.
      I also followed a YouTube video tutorial to make a game similar to "Space Invaders". I found that very
      fun! The only thing is that I can't remember any python at all, but I'm sure that I could pick it up quickly.
