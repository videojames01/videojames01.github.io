    I've been reviewing your answers and I noticed that you need to balance your work and your study for you want
    (or need) to work a lot of hours. HBO-ICT is a fulltime study program and therefore we expect that students
    spend about 40 hours per week on their study. About 50% of it are scheduled activities and we tend to plan
    them in the mornings from 9:00 up to about 15:00. It is also good to know that the first months we focus a
    lot on developing your programming skills, which you will be needing throughout the rest of the program as
    well. I want to be honest to you as well, but your intended working hours, in combination with your study
    choice and motivation triggered some alarm bells to me. In the past years, I have seen it happen to a lot
    students who enroll with similar intentions that they have a hard time progressing through the program and
    encounter all kinds of motivational, financial and even psychological problems because of that. I will not
    say that it will happen to you as well. Chances are of course that you discover that you like the ICT field
    of profession. The best advice I can give you is to really think through what you want to do for the next 5
    or so years. Do you want to invest a lot of hours into a future profession you don't really know much about
    just because you'll be in university?
