<p>Strengths: Hardworking, organised, good at problem solving. Weaknesses: Low self confidence, can get
    overwhelmed, indecisive. I see the opportunity to learn new things, and build new relationships. I am
    worried that working and studying might be too much. I am also a bit worried about having less programming
    experience than everyone else.</p>
