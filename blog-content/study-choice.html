  <h2>My Study Choice and Future</h2>
  <p>
    At the beginning of the year I had to choose between studying in Den Haag or Middelburg. I went to the HZ
    open day in March 2024 and that really helped to cement my decision to study here; the atmosphere was warm
    and the people were so friendly and welcoming. I also wanted to attend the online information session, but
    I was on holiday and completely forgot about. We got an email about it saying attendance was blow, and I felt
    really bad about it haha.
  </p>

    After school I'm hoping to get a good job. I'm not yet sure which field I'd like to work in, but I'm hoping
    to discover that as I get further into my studies. I'm also not sure which part of the world I'd like to be in;
    my family is in South Africa but I really enjoy it here in the Netherlands. I think that's also why I chose ICT,
    a lot of work can be done remotely, so I can have two different homes and still have one job.
