      <h2>Why ICT Suits Me</h2>
      <p>I like to think that ICT is a suitable field for me. In school my maths marks were average, but I've
        always excelled at languages. I know that ICT is a very maths-based study, but in my opinion it also
        has a lot to do with language. So I hope my natural affinity for languages helps me for the next four
        years.
